# Running the script requires Python. Installing Python also installs IDLE, Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDE). 
# IDLE is open source, but you can run the script using IDLE, the terminal, or any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.

# Instructions for first-time use:

# 1. Open the Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows).
#    - On macOS: You can find the Terminal in Applications > Utilities, or by pressing Command + Space and typing "Terminal".
#    - On Windows: Press Win + R, type "cmd" or "powershell", and press Enter.

# 2. Check if Python is installed by typing `python3 --version` and pressing Enter.
#    - If Python is not found, download and install the latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
#    - During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python [version number] to PATH" to ensure you can use Python from the command line.

# 3. Navigate to Your Project Directory:
#    Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where your project is stored. Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual file path.

#    - On macOS/Linux:
#        cd ~/path/to/your/project
#    
#    - On Windows (Command Prompt):
#        cd C:\path\to\your\project
#    
#    - On Windows (PowerShell):
#        Set-Location "C:\path\to\your\project"

#    Example Usage:
#    If your project is stored on a mounted network drive or external volume, adjust accordingly:
#
#    - Mac/Linux Example (Mounted Drive):
#        cd /Volumes/YourDriveName/ProjectFolder
#
#    - Windows Example (Mapped Drive or External Storage):
#        cd X:\ProjectFolder
#        (Replace `X:` with the correct drive letter.)

# 4. Optional: Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file by running:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#    (If using Python 3.12.5 or later, you may need to use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` instead.)
#
#    - If pip is not recognized, you may need to add Python and pip to PATH.
#    - The easiest fix is to reinstall Python and ensure the "Add Python to PATH" option is selected during installation.
#
#    However, this step is optional. The batchRename script includes a conditional check and will automatically install any missing packages.

# Required Python Packages:
pandas
moviepy
openpyxl
